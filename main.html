    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It is important to write efficient algorithms.</p>
<p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of working storage it needs. For example, an algorithm with a Space Complexity of O(n) requires linear space relative to the input size.</p>
