    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time Complexity is the number of operations needed to run an algorithm on large amounts of data. The number of operations can be considered as time because the computer uses some time for each operation, and it is important to make algorithms more efficient.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space.</p>
