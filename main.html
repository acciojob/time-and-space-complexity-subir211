	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a mathematical description of the rate at which 
		the computational time of an algorithm increases as the input size increases.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b>is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. 
		If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space</p>
