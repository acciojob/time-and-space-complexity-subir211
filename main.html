	<h1>Time Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a vital aspect of software engineering that impacts the design and implementation of algorithms and applications. By understanding and applying the principles of time complexity, developers can create more efficient, scalable, and cost-effective software solutions</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b>is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space.</p>
